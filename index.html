        <h1>Jujutsu Kaisen</h1>
        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>The story follows Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted teenager with extraordinary physical abilities. After encountering a cursed object (a severed finger belonging to the powerful Curse Ryomen Sukuna), he becomes the host for Sukuna and is pulled into the dangerous world of Jujutsu Sorcerers—people who fight Curses, evil spirits born from human negative emotions.

To prevent Sukuna’s power from falling into the wrong hands, Yuji joins the Tokyo Jujutsu High under the guidance of powerful sorcerer Satoru Gojo, aiming to collect and consume all of Sukuna’s fingers, knowing it will eventually lead to his own death.
